 * This program is used to take an input file and put the first 20
 * items. Then it will put it into order from largest to smallest 
 * while also outputing its ariginal position of how it's inputed.
 * If the list is larger than 20 integers it will flush the rest
 * to keep them from the array and prevvent bugs.
